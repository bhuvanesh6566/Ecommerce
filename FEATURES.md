  - High-quality product images from Unsplash
  - Product categories (Laptops, Accessories, Audio, Storage, etc.)
- **Frontend Display**: 
  - Beautiful product cards with image containers
  - Hover effects with image zoom
  - Fallback placeholder images if image fails to load
  - Category badges on each product card

### Image Features
- Images are displayed in a 200px height container
- Smooth hover zoom effect (scale 1.1x)
- Responsive design - images adapt to card size
- Error handling with placeholder images

## 🤖 Auto-Recommendation System

### Recommendation Engine (`recommendation_engine.py`)

The recommendation system uses a **similarity-based algorithm** that considers:

1. **Rating Similarity (40% weight)**: Products with similar ratings
2. **Category Similarity (30% weight)**: Products in the same category
3. **Price Similarity (20% weight)**: Products in similar price ranges
4. **Popularity Similarity (10% weight)**: Products with similar popularity scores

### Recommendation Types

#### 1. Product-Based Recommendations
- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/products/<product_id>/recommendations`
- **Usage**: Click any product card to see similar products
- **Algorithm**: Calculates similarity score for all products and returns top matches
- **Display**: Shows up to 5 recommended products

#### 2. Trending Products
- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/recommendations/trending`
- **Algorithm**: Combines rating (60%) and normalized popularity (40%)
- **Display**: Shown at the top of the page on load
- **Purpose**: Highlights popular, highly-rated products

#### 3. Category-Based Recommendations
- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/recommendations/category/<category>`
- **Algorithm**: Filters products by category, sorted by rating
- **Use Case**: Can be extended for category browsing

### Frontend Integration

#### Trending Section
- Displays automatically when page loads
- Shows top 5 trending products
- Located above the main product grid

#### Product Recommendations
- Appears when you click on any product
- Shows similar products based on the recommendation algorithm
- Smooth scroll animation to recommendations section
- Hidden during search operations

### User Experience

1. **On Page Load**:
   - Trending products displayed at top
   - All products shown below
   - Recommendations section hidden

2. **When Clicking a Product**:
   - Recommendations section appears
   - Shows 5 similar products
   - Smooth scroll to recommendations
   - Clickable product cards for further exploration

3. **During Search**:
   - Recommendations hidden
   - Focus on search results
   - Can still click products to see recommendations

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Similarity Calculation

```python
similarity = (
    rating_similarity * 0.4 +      # 40% weight
    category_similarity * 0.3 +    # 30% weight
    price_similarity * 0.2 +       # 20% weight
    popularity_similarity * 0.1    # 10% weight
)
```

### Image Sources
- Using Unsplash API for high-quality product images
- Images are optimized with `w=400` parameter
- Fallback to placeholder service if image fails

### Performance
- Recommendations calculated on-demand
- Trending products cached on page load
- Efficient similarity calculations (O(n) for recommendations)
- No database queries needed (in-memory operations)

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Get Recommendations for Product ID 1
```javascript
fetch('/api/products/1/recommendations?limit=5')
  .then(res => res.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data.recommendations));
```

### Get Trending Products
```javascript
fetch('/api/recommendations/trending?limit=5')
  .then(res => res.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data.products));
```

### Add Product with Image
```javascript
fetch('/api/products', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    product_id: 16,
    name: "New Product",
    price: 99.99,
    rating: 4.5,
    popularity: 1000,
    image_url: "https://example.com/image.jpg",

  })
});
```
